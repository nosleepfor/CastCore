# CastCore
----

This is NOT a GDPS core (yet).
This is just my experminetal project mostly for my own education, maybe someone finds it interesting but meh.
Its kinda badly written, all routes in one file, shit code e.t.c, blah blah blah.
Maybe if i'll not be lazy dumbass i'll rewrite it in the future.
Maybe sometime i will use it for my own GDPS.

## TODO
